# isPies Discord bot

## Overview

isPies is a fun and engaging Discord bot, inspired by the humorous variable "isPies" that was once found in the code of the [Polish State Railways (PKP)](https://twitter.com/lkurzyniec/status/971347604033425409) website. The bot's main functionality is to determine whether an uploaded image contains a dog or not. This feature is a playful nod to the "Hotdog/Not Hotdog" concept from the popular TV series, Silicon Valley.

## Technologies

The isPies bot is built using a variety of cutting-edge technologies, which include:

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes server-side code
- Discord.js: A powerful JavaScript library to interact with the Discord API
- TensorFlow: A versatile open-source machine learning library
- TypeScript: A strongly-typed superset of JavaScript, enabling better code organization and enhanced tooling

## Features

- **Dog Detection**: The primary function of the isPies bot is to determine whether an uploaded image contains a dog or not. This is achieved using advanced machine learning algorithms powered by TensorFlow.
- **Discord Integration**: isPies is seamlessly integrated with Discord via the Discord.js library, making it easy to use and interact with across different servers.
- **Robust and Maintainable Code**: The bot is developed using TypeScript, ensuring a well-structured and maintainable codebase.

## Usage

To use the isPies bot in your Discord server, simply follow these steps:

1. Invite the bot to your server using the provided link.
1. Grant the bot necessary permissions to access and manage messages in the channels you want it to operate in.
1. Upload an image to a channel where the bot has permissions, and the bot will automatically analyze the image and respond whether it contains a dog or not.

Enjoy using the isPies bot, and have fun discovering if there's a dog in your images!

## Future Development

The isPies bot has significant potential for growth and expansion in various directions. Some possible areas of development include:

1. **Additional Animal Detection**: Expanding the bot's capabilities to recognize and classify different types of animals, such as cats, birds, or fish, can make it more versatile and engaging for users.
1. **Breed Identification**: Enhancing the bot's machine learning algorithms to not only detect if an image contains a dog, but also to identify the specific breed of the dog. This feature can be informative and entertaining for dog enthusiasts.
1. **Image Filters and Effects**: Implementing fun image filters and effects that users can apply to their uploaded images, such as adding accessories (hats, glasses, etc.) to the detected dogs or modifying the image's color palette.
1. **Gamification**: Introducing a point-based system or leaderboards to encourage users to engage with the bot more frequently. Users could earn points for successful dog detections or participate in timed challenges to guess the most number of dogs in images within a given time frame.
1. **Multilingual Support**: To make the isPies bot accessible to a broader audience, adding support for multiple languages would be beneficial. This would involve localizing the bot's text responses and user interface elements to cater to non-English speaking users.
1. **Community-driven Improvements**: Allowing users to submit feedback or suggestions for improving the bot's detection capabilities or adding new features can foster a sense of community and ensure that the bot continues to evolve in line with user expectations.

These are just a few ideas for potential future development, but the possibilities are vast, and the isPies bot can continue to grow and evolve to better serve its user community.
